    "@value" : "Aetiology\n\nSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of the Coronaviridae family, and is the seventh\ncoronavirus known to infect humans. The virus has been found to be similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses from bats, but it is distinct from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. The full genome has been determined and published in GenBank.\n\n[GenBank] A preliminary study suggests that there are two major types (or strains) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in China, designated L and S. The L type was found to be more prevalent during the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan City and may be more aggressive (although this is speculative), but its frequency decreased after early January. The relevance of this finding is unknown at this stage and further research is required.\n\nCoronaviruses are a large family of enveloped RNA viruses, some of which cause illness in people (e.g., common cold, SARS, MERS), and others that circulate among mammals (e.g., bats, camels) and birds.\n\nRarely, animal coronaviruses can spread to humans and subsequently spread between people, as was the case with SARS and MERS.\n\nA majority of patients in the initial stages of this outbreak reported a link to the Huanan South China Seafood Market, a live animal or ‘wet’ market, suggesting a zoonotic origin of the virus. \n\nWhile the potential animal reservoir and intermediary host(s) are unknown at this point, studies suggest they may derive from a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus; however, this is yet to be confirmed.\n\nTransmission dynamics of the virus are currently unknown and the situation is evolving. Person-to-person spread has been confirmed in community and healthcare settings in China and other countries.\n\nAn initial assessment of the transmission dynamics in the first 425 confirmed cases found that 55% of cases before 1 January 2020 were linked to the Huanan South China Seafood Market, whereas only 8.6% of cases after this date were linked to the market. This confirms that person-to-person spread occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019, including infections in healthcare workers. \n\nOne study of a family cluster of five patients in Shenzhen who had a history of travel to Wuhan City (with one other family member who did not travel to Wuhan City) found that person-to-person spread is possible in both hospital and family settings.\n\nNosocomial transmission in healthcare workers and patients has been reported in 41% of patients in one case series. \n\nIt is uncertain how easily the virus spreads between people, but transmission in chains involving several links is increasingly recognised. Similar to SARS and MERS, it is thought that human transmission occurs via respiratory droplets produced when a person sneezes or coughs. The contribution to transmission by the presence of the virus in other body fluids is unknown; however, the virus has been detected in blood, saliva, tears, and conjunctival secretions, and faecal transmission may also be possible.\n\nAn early report of of transmission from an asymptomatic contact in Germany has been criticised.\n\nHowever, there is mounting evidence that spread from asymptomatic contacts can occur and has been observed in endemic areas.\n\nAnecdotal reports suggest that some people can act as superspreaders early in the course of their infection. These individuals can pass the infection on to large numbers of contacts, including healthcare workers. This phenomenon is well documented for infections such as SARS and Ebola virus infection, and more recently with MERS.\n\nSome of these individuals are also supershedders of virus, but the reasons underlying superspreader events are often more complex than just excess virus shedding and can include a variety of behavioural and environmental factors.\n\nIt is unknown whether perinatal transmission or transmission via breastfeeding is possible; however perinatal transmission has been suspected in one case. \n\nRetrospective reviews of pregnant women with COVID-19 found that there is no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop the infection late in pregnancy. \n\nHowever, there is currently a lack of data about the risk of transmission to the newborn during vaginal delivery."

Large-scale screening in non-endemic\nareas may pick up more of these types of patients. A milder clinical course has been reported in cases\nidentified outside of China, with most patients being healthy adults.\nBased on an early analysis of case series, the most common symptoms are:\n• Fever\n• Cough\n• Dyspnoea\n• Myalgia\n• Fatigue.\nLess common symptoms include:\n• Anorexia\n• Sputum production\n• Sore throat\n• Confusion\n• Dizziness\n• Headache\n• Rhinorrhoea\n• Chest pain\n• Haemoptysis\n• Diarrhoea\n• Nausea/vomiting\n• Abdominal pain\n• Conjunctival congestion\n\nApproximately 90% of patients present with more than one symptom, and 15% of patients present with\nfever, cough, and dyspnoea.

This phenomenon was also\nreported with MERS.\nPerform a physical examination. Patients may be febrile (with or without chills/rigors) and have obvious\ncough and/or difficulty breathing. Auscultation of the chest may reveal inspiratory crackles, rales, and/or\nbronchial breathing in patients with pneumonia or respiratory distress.

However, masks may be worn in some countries\naccording to local cultural habits. Individuals with fever and/or respiratory symptoms are advised to wear a mask, particularly in endemic areas.\n\n• It is mandatory to wear a medical mask in public in certain areas of China, and local guidance should be consulted for more information.\n\n• It is important to wash your hands with soap and water (or an alcohol-based sanitiser) prior to putting on a face mask.\n\n• [BMJ: facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings]\n\nScreening and quarantine\n\n• People travelling from areas with a high risk of infection may be screened using questionnaires about their travel, contact with ill persons, symptoms of infection, and/or measurement of their temperature. Combined screening of airline passengers on exit from an affected area and on arrival elsewhere has been relatively ineffective when used for other infections such as Ebola virus infection, and has been modelled to miss up to 50% of cases of COVID-19, particularly those with no symptoms during an incubation period, which may exceed 10 days. Symptom-based screening processes have been reported to be ineffective in detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in a small number of patients who were later found to have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in a throat swab.\n\n• Enforced quarantine has been used in some countries to isolate easily identifiable cohorts of people at potential risk of recent exposure (e.g., groups evacuated by aeroplane from affected areas, or groups on cruise ships with infected people on board). The psychosocial effects of enforced quarantine may have long-lasting repercussions.\n\nVaccine\n\n• There is currently no vaccine available. Vaccines are in development, but it may take up to 12 months\nbefore a vaccine is available.[56] An mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) has been shipped to the National\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for phase 1 clinical trials in the US, with an estimated start\ndate of 19 March 2020.[57]"

The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission is reported to be approximately 7 days.[5] [7] Patients with impending or established respiratory failure should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Between 23% to 32% of hospitalised patients require intensive care for respiratory support.[5] [6] [7] However, this estimate may be lower based on current case counts. Symptomatic patients who no longer require hospitalisation may be considered for home care if suitable (see below).\n-Supportive therapies\n• Oxygen: give supplemental oxygen at a rate of 5 L/minute to patients with severe acute respiratory infection and respiratory distress, hypoxaemia, or shock. Titrate flow rates to reach a target SpO₂ ≥90%.[80]\n• Fluids: manage fluids conservatively in patients with severe acute respiratory infection when there is no evidence of shock as aggressive fluid resuscitation may worsen oxygenation.\n• Symptom relief: give an antipyretic/analgesic for the relief of fever and pain.\n• Antimicrobials: consider starting empirical antimicrobials in patients with suspected infection to cover other potential bacterial pathogens that may cause respiratory infection according to local protocols. Give within 1 hour of initial patient assessment for patients with suspected sepsis. Choice of empirical antimicrobials should be based on the clinical diagnosis, and ocal epidemiology and susceptibility data. Consider treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor until influenza is ruled out. De-escalate empirical therapy based on test results and clinical judgement.[80] Some patients with severe illness may require continued antimicrobial therapy once COVID-19 has been confirmed depending on the clinical circumstances.\n-Monitoring\n• Monitor patients closely for signs of clinical deterioration, such as rapidly progressive respiratory failure and sepsis, and start general supportive care interventions as indicated (e.g., haemodialysis, vasopressor therapy, fluid resuscitation, ventilation, antimicrobials) as appropriate.\n• It is important to follow local infection prevention and control procedures to prevent transmission to healthcare workers. Endotracheal intubation should be performed by an experienced provider using airborne precautions.\n• Intubation and mechanical ventilation are recommended in patients who are deteriorating and cannot maintain an SpO₂ ≥90% with oxygen therapy.[80] Some patients may develop severe hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring a high fraction of inspired oxygen, and high air flow rates to\nmatch inspiratory flow demand. Patients may also have increased work of breathing, demanding positive pressure breathing assistance.\n• High-flow nasal oxygen and non-invasive ventilation are recommended in select patients. Mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome should receive a lungprotective, low tidal volume/low inspiratory pressure ventilation strategy. Those with persistent severe hypoxic failure should be considered for prone ventilation.\n• The risk of treatment failure is high in patients with non-acutely reversible conditions, and there is also concern about nosocomial transmission with open ventilation systems and suboptimal noninvasive face mask or nasal pillow seals. More research to define the balance of benefits and risks to patients and health workers is needed.\n• Some patients may require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) according to availability and expertise."

However, patients in home isolation should be advised to limit their interaction, and avoid direct contact with their pets and other animals, especially while they are symptomatic.\nSupportive therapies\n• Recommend symptomatic therapies such as an antipyretic/analgesic, and advise patients to keep hydrated but not to take too much fluid as this can worsen oxygenation.\nMonitoring\n• Monitor patients closely and advise them to seek medical care if symptoms worsen as mild illness can rapidly progress to lower respiratory tract disease.\n\nMore detailed guidance on home care is available from the WHO and the CDC:\n\n• [WHO: home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection presenting with mild symptoms, and management of their contacts]\n• [CDC: interim guidance for implementing home care of people not requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]"

Abnormal chest CT findings have been reported in up to 97% of patients in one meta-analysis of 50,466 hospitalised patients. CT is the primary imaging modality in China.\n• CT imaging generally shows bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of ground-glass opacity or consolidation in most patients. Other features include interlobular or septal thickening (smooth or irregular), thickening of the adjacent pleura, and air bronchograms. Some patients may present with pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and round cystic changes. None of these findings appear to be specific or diagnostic for COVID-19. Abnormalities can rapidly evolve from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progress to, or co-exist with, consolidations within 1 to 3 weeks.\n• Small nodular ground-glass opacities are the most common finding in children.Consolidation with surrounding halo signs is a typical finding in children.\n• Evidence of viral pneumonia on CT may precede a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 in some patients. However, CT imaging abnormalities may be present in asymptomatic patients.\n• In a cohort of over 1000 patients in a hyperendemic area in China, chest CT had a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with initial RT-PCR from swab samples (88% versus 59%). Improvement of abnormal CT findings also preceded change from RT-PCR positivity to negativity in this cohort during recovery. The sensitivity of chest CT was 97% in patients who ultimately had positive RT-PCR results. However, in this setting, 75% of patients with negative RT-PCR results also had positive chest CT findings.

Transmission may be possible during the incubation period.\n\nPreliminary reports suggest that the reproductive number (R₀), the number of people who acquire the infection from an infected person, is approximately 2.2.\n\nHowever, as the situation is still evolving, the R₀ may actually be higher or lower. The secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 0.45% for close contacts of US patients.\n\nWhile the pathophysiology of this condition is currently unknown, it is thought that the virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in humans, which suggests that it may have a similar pathogenesis to SARS.\n\nHowever, a unique structural feature of the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 (which is responsible for the entry of the virus into host cells) confers potentially higher binding affinity for ACE2 on host cells compared to SARS-CoV. A furin-like cleavage site has been identified in the spike protein of the virus; this does not exist in other SARS-like coronaviruses.\n\nHigh viral loads have been detected in nasal and throat swabs soon after symptom onset, and it is thought that the viral shedding pattern may be similar to that of patients with influenza.

Local transmission has been reported in many countries. Italy, Iran, and South Korea have the most number of cases outside of China.\nHOW MANY - The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently published data from the largest case series to date (72,314 cases from 31 December 2019 to 11 February 2020). The majority of confirmed cases (87%)\nwere aged 30 to 79 years, 1% were aged 9 years or younger, 1% were aged 10 to 19 years, and 3% were aged 80 years or older. Approximately 51% of patients were male and 49% were female.

Abnormal chest CT findings have been reported in up to 97% of patients in one meta-analysis of 50,466 hospitalised patients. CT is the primary imaging modality in China.\n• CT imaging generally shows bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of ground-glass opacity or consolidation in most patients. Other features include interlobular or septal thickening (smooth or irregular), thickening of the adjacent pleura, and air bronchograms. Some patients may present with pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and round cystic changes. None of these findings appear to be specific or diagnostic for COVID-19. Abnormalities can rapidly evolve from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progress to, or co-exist with, consolidations within 1 to 3 weeks.\n• Small nodular ground-glass opacities are the most common finding in children.Consolidation with surrounding halo signs is a typical finding in children.\n• Evidence of viral pneumonia on CT may precede a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 in some patients. However, CT imaging abnormalities may be present in asymptomatic patients.\n• In a cohort of over 1000 patients in a hyperendemic area in China, chest CT had a higher sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19 compared with initial RT-PCR from swab samples (88% versus 59%). Improvement of abnormal CT findings also preceded change from RT-PCR positivity to negativity in this cohort during recovery. The sensitivity of chest CT was 97% in patients who ultimately had positive RT-PCR results. However, in this setting, 75% of patients with negative RT-PCR results also had positive chest CT findings. Of\nthese patients, 48% were considered highly likely cases, while 33% were considered probable cases.\n-computed tomography (CT) chest Result\nbilateral ground-glass opacity or consolidation"
