Avoid close contact people i e maintain distance least 1 metre [3 feet] particularly those who have fever are coughing sneezing Practice respiratory hygiene i e cover mouth nose when coughing sneezing discard tissue immediately closed bin wash hands Seek medical care have fever cough difficulty breathing share their previous travel contact history their healthcare provider Avoid direct unprotected contact live animals surfaces contact live animals when visiting live markets affected Avoid consumption raw undercooked animal products handle raw meat milk animal organs care per usual good food safety practices [WHO: coronavirus disease COVID-19 advice public] Medical masks World Health Organization WHO does not recommend people wear medical mask community settings do not have respiratory symptoms no evidence available usefulness protect people who are not ill However masks worn countries according local cultural habits Individuals fever respiratory symptoms are advised wear mask
