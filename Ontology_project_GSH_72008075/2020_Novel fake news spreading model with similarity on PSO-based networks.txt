that 62 percent of US adults obtain news through social media Users post and repost information  news  photos  videos on their social network accounts which are seldom verified In the 2016 United States presidential election  the fake news about pro-Trump was shared for 30 million times  and the fake news about pro-Clinton was shared for 7.6 million times People’s trust in social media is much lower than traditional print and outlets  it is proposed in that fake news is diffused far rapidly and widely than the truth Complex network is a fundamental tool used by researchers for understanding and modeling social  biological  and physical systems in which the nodes represent individuals or organizations  and the edges represent the interactions among them For social networks  the nodes represent the individuals and the edges represent the relationship them Real-world networks are mostly heterogeneous networks  where a few nodes have very large degrees  and the vast majority of nodes have very small degrees The distribution of nodes follows a power-law distribution  scale-free property where k denotes the degree of nodes  and γ is a parameter that ranges 2 and 3 for most real-world networks Epidemic spreading is a common phenomenon in the complex networks such as virus spreading in computer networks  and fake news spreading in social networks The modeling of epidemic spreading can be used to investigating how diseases  spread among individuals Mean-field approximation has been very successful in modeling epidemic spreading processes  and the most common mean-field models are the susceptible–infected–susceptible  SIS  model and the Susceptible–Infected–Removed  SIR  model It is worth mentioning that the epidemic threshold in an infinite-size scale-free network tends to vanish for the SIS and the SIR models The spreading of the fake news and rumors can be seen as ‘infection of the mind’ Daley and Kendall introduced the DK model to modeling the rumor spreading  which is the original model of rumor spreading In this model  the individuals are classified into three different categories  ignorants  denoted by I  those who have not got the rumor spreaders  denoted by S  those who are spreading the rumor and stiflers  denoted by R  those who know the rumor and do not spread it  The rumor spreads when a spreader is involved in a pairwise contact When a spreader meets an ignorant  the ignorant a spreader When a spreader meets spreader or stifler  the spreader a stifler Maki and Thompson developed the DK model to the MK model  in which they proposed that the rumor is spread by directed contacts of the spreaders with other individuals  when a spreader meets spreader  only the initiative spreader into a stifler the DK and the MK models assume that the individuals contact with each other randomly  which is a homogeneous mixing approximation Moreno investigated the dynamics of the rumor spreading model on the heterogeneous networks  the results show that network heterogeneity has a considerable effect on the dynamics of rumor spreading Nekovee investigated the threshold behavior of the rumor spreading on the homogeneous and the heterogeneous networks  the results show that the heterogeneous social networks are prone to spread rumors Roshani proposed a generalized rumor spreading model on top of heterogeneous networks with consideration of degree-biased transmission rate and nonlinear infectivity  showing that the threshold of their model is larger than that of the  standard rumor spreading model In the above-mentioned rumor spreading models on heterogenous networks  it is assumed that the degree of nodes is a key factor affecting the spreading It was proposed in that the degree  known as popularity  is just dimension of attractiveness dimension is That is  new connections are connected to the popular nodes and the  nodes in growing networks  which is called the Popularity and Optimization PSO  algorithm For instance  a new Twitter user will not only follow the influential individuals but also follow  individuals such as his/her friends or families or those who have  interests  even if the  individuals are not popular In the social networks  when an ignorant individual receives fake news from a spreader  the  they are  the ignorant is likely to believe the fake news and spread it In this paper  we propose a fake news spreading model on the PSO-based networks  in which the is taken into account For simplicity  a commonly-used SIR model is adopted due to its effectiveness in describing the dynamics of much real-world rumor spreading phenomena In this model  the individuals are classified into three different categories  ignorants  denoted by I  those who have not got the fake news spreaders denoted by S  those are spreading the fake news and stiflers  denoted by R  those who know the fake news and do not spread it  When an ignorant interacts with a spreader  the ignorant to a spreader with probability λ When a spreader interacts with spreader or stifler  the spreader to be a stifler with probability σ  while a spreader may also become a stifler with probability δ spontaneously without any contact It is worth noting that λ depends on the of the individuals in our model The contributions of this paper include: 1 A fake news spreading model with on the PSO-based networks is proposed To the best of our knowledge  this is the time when the fake news spreading model is investigated on the PSO-based networks 2 Also for the time  the individuals is introduced into modeling fake news spreading on the PSO-based networks 3 The critical threshold and maximum spreading are obtained for the proposed model The remainder of this paper is organized as follows 2 provides preliminaries on the PSO-based networks  the hyperbolic network model  and the standard rumor spreading model on the heterogeneous networks In 3  the fake news spreading model with on the PSO-based networks is proposed 4 presents simulation results on the proposed model 5 concludes the paper and outlines some future work 2 Preliminaries 2.1 PSO-based networks In this section  a simple way to generate a PSO-based network is reviewed and details can be found in It was proposed in that popularity is just facet of node attractiveness in growing networks  and the is important aspect that cannot be neglected In real-world networks  new nodes seek to link to the popular nodes and the  nodes To describe this phenomenon  the PSO algorithm model is proposed in which the links are generated with the balance of the popularity and the  as follows First  the network is empty at the initial time t = 0 Second  at each time t  t = 1  2  3 . new node t is generated  and t is also called the age of the node It is assumed that the older nodes are popular due to they have opportunities to attract connections The nodes can be placed on a disk  and each of them corresponds to a pair of polar coordinates  the radius coordinate t  and the  D Song  Physica A 549  2020  124319 3 1 Network topology of PSO-based networks  the of nodes N = 500  the radius of disk R = 11  average degree power-law

 It is worth stressing that sθts includes the popularity and the The power-law exponent of the generated network can be adjusted by replacing sθts with s β  θts  0 ≤ β ≤ 1  in the PSO- based networks model  the clustering coefficient of the generated network can be controlled by the network temperature  T  The difference the BA network model and the PSO-based networks model is that new nodes connect to nodes of degree k with the same probability in the BA model  while new nodes connect to the most  nodes in the k-degree nodes in the PSO-based networks model 2.2 Hyperbolic network model It was proposed in [22 23] that PSO-based networks can be embedded in the hyperbolic space A simple way to form a PSO-based network in the hyperbolic space contains three steps First  place N nodes on a disk with radius R  the radius of nodes follows ρ r  = αe α r−R  and the angular of nodes follows ρ θ  = 1 2π where the parameter α > 0 Hence  each node corresponds to a  r  θ  coordinate pair  where r represents polar radius and θ represents the polar angular Second  for each pair of nodes  the hyperbolic distance them is calculated by where the coordinates of the nodes denotes the angular distance the nodes ζ = √ |K| and is constant  where denotes the constant curvature of hyperbolic space Finally  whether nodes are connected depends on the connection probability where d is the hyperbolic distance nodes  and T is the network temperature when the hyperbolic distance every nodes is less than R  the nodes are connected generated PSO-based networks with 500 nodes are shown in 1  the power-law degree distribution −3  When a node is located near the center of the disk  that means it is popular When the angular distance nodes is smaller  the nodes are  The average clustering coefficient is 0.75 for the network with temperature T = 0  and the average clustering coefficient is 0.41 for the network with temperature T = 0.5 2.3 Standard SIR rumor spreading model on heterogeneous networks In this subsection  a commonly-used SIR rumor spreading model on heterogeneous networks is reviewed  and details can be found in The individuals are classified into three different categories  the ignorants  the spreaders  and the stiflers The densities of the ignorants  the spreaders and the stiflers with degree k at time t are denoted as and Rk t  respectively and Rk t  satisfy the condition + + Rk t  = 1 The mean-field equations for the dynamics of rumor spreading on complex networks with arbitrary degree correlations are as follows  d = −kλ ∑ l 1a d = kλ ∑ l −

probability that an ignorant to a spreader  when an ignorant interacts with a spreader σ denotes the probability that an ignorant to a spreader  when a spreader interacts with spreader or stifler δ

probability that a link originating  from an individual with degree k points to a spreader or a stifler at time t 3 Fake news spreading model with 3.1 The relationship the of connected nodes and the product of their degrees In this subsection  the relationship the of connected nodes and the product of their degrees is investigated by simulations The PSO-based networks with 5000 nodes are generated by the method mentioned in 2.2 for simulation  the average degrees of these networks are set as T is varying from 0 to 1 2 shows the relationship the angular distance of each pair of connected nodes and the product of their degrees on PSO-based networks For T = 0 2 a  shows that the angular distance a pair of connected nodes as the product of their degrees k · l increases  which is positively correlated For T = 0.5 2 b  shows the correlation is smaller than that of T = 0 For T = 1 2 c  shows the correlation disappears To investigate the effect of the temperature T on the correlations  the Pearson correlation coefficient of the angular distance and the product of the degrees k · l is adopted for analysis 3 a  shows that the Pearson correlation coefficient decreases as the temperature T increases For smaller T if a pair of nodes with lower degrees can be connected  the them must be larger  while a pair of nodes with larger degrees can be connected  the them inclines to be smaller 3 b  shows that the average clustering coefficient decreases as the temperature T increases In this paper  our model is proposed under the assumption that the angular distance of a pair of connected nodes and their product of the degrees is highly correlated  that is  the temperature is smaller or the average clustering coefficient of the network is larger 3.2 Model The fake news spreading model with will be proposed in this subsection In the diffusion process of fake news  when an ignorant individual receives fake news from a spreader  the  they are  the ignorant is likely to believe the fake news and spread it Based on this assumption  our model differs from the standard model in terms of spreading probability λ λ is constant in the standard model  while the spreading rates connected nodes are to their in our model  which are denoted as λS  Each individual of the network can be in of three states  ignorants  spreaders  and stiflers  and the proposed model is composed of possible transitions The is denoted by I-S  when a spreader i publishes fake news on the online social network  an ignorant j may spread this fake news with the probability λS = λC i j

contacts a spreader  the  they are  the ignorant is likely to become a spreader The second transmission is denoted by S-R  When a spreader interacts with spreader or stifler  the spreader to be a stifler with probability σ  where σ denotes the transmission probability and is a constant Meanwhile  a spreader may also stop spreading the fake news spontaneously with probability δ due to forgetting or other reasons Based on the standard rumor spreading model  the fake news spreading model with is described by the following equations As presented in the a pair of connected nodes is to the product of their degrees Based on this  the angular distance l  k  in Eqs  2a  and  2b  can be expressed as a function of their degrees  which is where is the function and as the degree of nodes increases In this paper  we focus on uncorrelated networks where the conditional probability satisfies Therefore  by replacing l  k and with and lP l in Eq  2 the following equations are obtained Song Physica The threshold and maximum spreading In this subsection  the threshold and maximum spreading of the proposed model in Eq  3  are analyzed Eq  3a  can be integrated directly  yielding where is
